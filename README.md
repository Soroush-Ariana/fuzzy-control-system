# Fuzzy Logic System for Linguistic Input Control
This project implements a fuzzy logic system designed to control a specific problem using linguistic inputs. The system leverages fuzzy logic principles to interpret and manage input data described in qualitative terms, enabling flexible and effective control over complex, real-world scenarios.
